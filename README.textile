h2. Irrlicht for Mobile

This is a branch of irrlicht working on iOS, android, Windows, Linux & MacOS X!

For android both OpenGLES1 and OpenGLES2 drivers are ported but only GLES1 has been tested, GLES2 compiles ok, but not tested, I have no device to test this.

For iOS there is only GLES1 driver works.

h2. Build

To build irrmob you should have CMake installed.

For more information, please read the CMakeLists.txt youself, it is so simple to understand.

h2. Have fun
